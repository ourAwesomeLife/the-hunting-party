The Hunting Party is a camp dedicated to providing a safe space for people to better understand themselves and the world around them through interaction and community. By day, come join us in our exploration of movement, creativity, authentic communication, and health-conscious nourishment: homemade kimchi and free-range, cage-free & humanely raised juice.  By night, join us in our pursuit of spontaneous conversation and adventure in our dome which will transform into a chill-out environment encouraging connection (save the occasional aggressive dance party).
